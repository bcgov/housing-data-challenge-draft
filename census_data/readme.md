## `cancensus`

Another option for accessing Census and NHS data in R is through [the `cancensus` package](https://github.com/mountainMath/cancensus).

The package requires 

* [`devtools`](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) (available from CRAN) and 

* an API key, obtained by registering at MountainMath.ca
